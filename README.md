# Annotator

Annotator is a modern web application that lets you highlight, annotate, and link resources to your text. Designed for research, study, and content enrichment, Annotator makes it easy to manage and connect information within your documents. Features include smart entity detection, resource linking (e.g., to Wikipedia or your own notes), and an intuitive interface for editing and managing annotations.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
